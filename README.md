# Diamond Price prediction

The unit of observation is the diamond, the dataset we have consists of several attributes, and each diamond is a data point.  The goal is to build a predictive model that predicts the price of diamonds, as accurately as possible, based on those features. For the problem we have defined, the target is the price of the diamond, and our features will be the nine remaining columns in our dataset: carat, cut, color, clarity, x, y, z, depth, and table. The type of variable I have to predict is a continuous variable (price). Since I am predicting a continuous variable (Price), I am trying to solve a regression problem in predictive analytics we usually use metrics. Since I am dealing with a regression problem, and there are many standardized metrics that are routinely used for these problems, I will usually use one or some of these metrics and evaluate the model. We must choose a metric that is appropriate for the problem, but sometimes none of the standard metrics will be useful, so it may be that we need to build our own personalized metric or metrics.
